## Scientific impact in numbers
Since 2015, DAIC has facilitated more than 2000 scientific outputs from the various DAIC-participating departments:


|                 | Article | Conference/Meeting contribution | Book/Book chapter/Book editing | Dissertation (TU Delft) | Abstract | Other | Editorial | Patent | **Grand Total** |
| --------------- | --------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------- | --------- | -------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------- | --------------- |
| **Grand Total** | 1067               | 854              | 123                    | 99           | 69     | 32         | 29                         | 8                    | **2281**        |

These outputs span a wide range of application areas, with titles reflecting an emphasis on data analysis and machine learning:
