## Access and accounts
* Accessing the HPC System
* User Account Creation and Password Management
* User Responsibilities and Acceptable Usage


Current workflow:
1. PIs/PhDs send email to the contact person and/or Robbert
2. contact person grants access; sometimes provides documentation links

Agreed upon:
1. Part of the documentation gives users a form:
  * form sends info to the correct contact person
  * form asks for: department, section, research group, intended duration of usage- 
    - a reminder about account expiration is sent to user (4 weeks, 2 weeks, 1 week, and 1 day reminder). 
    - account is deactivated after this period, unless user (and PI) request extension
    - email is sent, asking user to add any publication from using cluster was published
2. Once user is added, the user recieves onboarding instructions:
  * links to documentaiton, highlihgting the quick start part
  * links to support channels (mattermost)
  * reminder about citing the cluster
3.
