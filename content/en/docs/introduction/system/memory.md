  What memory (RAM) is available?
---

All machines have large main memories for performing computations on big data sets. A job cannot use more than it's allocated amount of memory. If it needs to use more memory, it will fail or be killed. It's not possible to combine the memory from multiple nodes for a single task. 32-bit programs can only address (use) up to 3Gb (gigabytes) of memory. See [submitting jobs](../../../manual/job-submission/job-scripts) for setting resources for batch jobs.
