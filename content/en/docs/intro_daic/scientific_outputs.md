The compilation of this list began in August 2023, and as a result, some older papers are not included. It is also based on self-reporting by individual researchers, so it may not be exhaustive. If you wish to include your paper(s) in this list, please post to the [ScientificOutput MatterMost channel](https://mattermost.tudelft.nl/daic/channels/scientificoutput).
