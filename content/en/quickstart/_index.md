## Login via SSH

1. Open your terminal and run the following SSH command:

```shell-session
$ ssh <YouNetID>@login.daic.tudelft.nl
```

{{% alert title="Outside access" color="info" %}}
If you are outside the TU Delft network you should first login to the TU Delft network with [eduVPN](https://tudelft.eduvpn.nl/portal/home). For more information about configuring SSH and the VPN, please visit [How to connect to DAIC?](/docs/manual/connecting).

2. You will be prompted for your password:

```shell-session
The HPC cluster is restricted to authorized users only.

Congratulations, you just logged in to the Delft AI Cluster!

## Submit a job to SLURM

To submit a Python script using SLURM:

1. Create a Python script, eg, the file below named `script.py`:
   {{< card code=true header="**script.py**" lang="python" >}}
   import time
   time.sleep(60)  # Simulate some work.
   print("Hello SLURM!")
   {{< /card >}}


2. Create a SLURM submission file `submit.sh` with the following content:

   {{< card code=true header="**submit.sh**" lang="bash" >}}
   #!/bin/sh
   #SBATCH --partition=general   # Request partition. Default is 'general'. Select the best partition following the advice on  https://daic.tudelft.nl/docs/manual/job-submission/priorities/#priority-tiers
   #SBATCH --qos=short           # Request Quality of Service. Default is 'short' (maximum run time: 4 hours)
   #SBATCH --time=0:05:00        # Request run time (wall-clock). Default is 1 minute
   #SBATCH --ntasks=1            # Request number of parallel tasks per job. Default is 1
   #SBATCH --cpus-per-task=2     # Request number of CPUs (threads) per task. Default is 1 (note: CPUs are always allocated to jobs per 2).
   #SBATCH --mem=1GB             # Request memory (MB) per node. Default is 1024MB (1GB). For multiple tasks, specify --mem-per-cpu instead
   #SBATCH --mail-type=END       # Set mail type to 'END' to receive a mail when the job finishes. 
   #SBATCH --output=slurm_%j.out # Set name of output log. %j is the Slurm jobId
   #SBATCH --error=slurm_%j.err  # Set name of error log. %j is the Slurm jobId
   
   # Some debugging logs
   which python 1>&2  # Write path to Python binary to standard error
   python --version   # Write Python version to standard error
   
   # Run your script with the `srun` command:
   srun python script.py
   {{< /card >}}


{{% alert title="Note" color="info" %}}
It is important to run your script with the `srun` command. `srun` is a command in SLURM used to submit and manage parallel or batch jobs on a cluster. It allocates resources, executes tasks, monitors job progress, and returns job output to users.
{{% /alert %}}


3. Submit the job to the queuing system with the `sbatch` command:
   ```shell-session
   $ sbatch submit.sh 
   Submitted batch job 9267828
   ```
4. Monitor the job’s progress with the `squeue` command:
    ```shell-session
    $ squeue -u $USER 
    JOBID PARTITION     NAME     USER ST       TIME  NODES NODELIST(REASON)
    9267834   general script.s <netid>   R       0:18      1 grs1
    ```

5. When your job finishes you will get a notification via email. Then you can see that two files have been created in your home directory, or in the directory where you submitted the job: `slurm_9267834.out` and `slurm_9267834.err` where the number corresponds to the job-id that SLURM had assigned to your job. You can see the content of the files with the `cat` command:
    ```shell-session
    $ cat slurm_9267834.err
    /usr/bin/python
    Python 2.7.5
    
    $ cat slurm_9267834.out
    Hello SLURM!
    ```

You can see that the standard output of your script has been written to the file `slurm_9267834.out` and the standard error was written to `slurm_9267834.err`. For more useful commands at your disposal have a look [here](/docs/manual/commands).

For more detailed job submission instructions, see [Job Submission](/docs/manual/job-submission/).

## Next Steps

It is strongly recommended that users read the [Containers Tutorial](/tutorials/apptainer/). Using containers simplifies the process of setting up reproducible environments for your workflows, especially when working with different dependencies and software versions.
