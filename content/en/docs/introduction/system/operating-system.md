At present [DAIC](https://daic.pages.ewi.tudelft.nl/docs/) and [DelftBlue](https://doc.dhpc.tudelft.nl/delftblue) have different software stacks. This pertains to the operating system (CentOS 7 _vs_ Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8, respectively) and, consequently, the available software. Please refer to the respective [DelftBlue modules](https://doc.dhpc.tudelft.nl/delftblue/DHPC-modules/) and [Available software](/docs/manual/software/available-software) documentation before commencing your experiments.

## Operating System

DAIC runs the {{< external-link "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CentOS" "CentOS" >}} 7 Linux distribution, which provides the general Linux software. Most common software, including programming languages, libraries and development files for compiling your own software, is installed on the servers (see [Available software](../../../manual/software/available-software)). However, a not-so-common program that you need might not be installed. Similarly, if your research requires a state-of-the-art program that is not (yet) available as a package for {{< external-link "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CentOS" "CentOS" >}} 7, then it is not available. See [Installing software](../../../manual/software/installing-software/) for more information.
