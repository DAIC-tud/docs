DAIC (formerly known as INSY-HPC or just plainly HPC) is a TU Delft High Performance Computing (HPC) cluster consisting of Linux compute servers with a lot of processing power and memory for running large, long or GPU-enabled jobs. DAIC was initiated within the INSY department in 2015, and later, resources were joined with ST (both from EWI), and with other departments across TU Delft faculties (TNW, TPM, 3mE and CiTG). The cluster is available (only) to users from the participating departments, and access can be arranged through the department's contact persons.

### What is an HPC cluster?

A High Performance Computing (HPC) cluster, is a collection of (large) computing resources, like Processors (CPUs), Graphics processors (GPUs), Memory and Storage, that are shared among a group of users. Using multiple computers as such makes it possible to perform lengthy and resource-intense computations beyond the capabilities of a single computer, and is especially handy for modern scientific computing applications where datasets are typically large in size, models are big in parameters' size and complexity, and computations need specialized hardware (like GPUs and FPGAs).
