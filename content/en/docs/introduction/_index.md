  What are the foundational components of DAIC?
---

DAIC (formerly known as INSY-HPC or just plainly HPC) is a TU Delft High Performance Computing (HPC) cluster consisting of Linux compute servers with a lot of processing power and memory for running large, long or GPU-enabled jobs. DAIC was initiated within the INSY department in 2015, and later, resources were joined with ST (both from EWI), and with other departments across TU Delft faculties (TNW, TPM, 3mE and CiTG). The cluster is available (only) to users from the participating departments, and access can be arranged through the department's contact persons (see [Access and accounts](/docs/policies#access-and-accounts)).

### What is an HPC cluster?
{{< figure src="/img/DAIC_partitions.png" caption="DAIC partitions and access/usage best practices" ref="fig:daic_partitions" width="750px">}}

A High Performance Computing (HPC) cluster, is a collection of (large) computing resources, like Processors (CPUs), Graphics processors (GPUs), Memory and Storage, that are shared among a group of users. Using multiple computers as such makes it possible to perform lengthy and resource-intense computations beyond the capabilities of a single computer, and is especially handy for modern scientific computing applications where datasets are typically large in size, models are big in parameters' size and complexity, and computations need specialized hardware (like GPUs and FPGAs). 

## Contributing departments
The Delft AI Cluster (DAIC - formerly known as INSY-HPC or just plainly HPC) is an HPC cluster that was initiated within the INSY department in 2015. Later, resources were joined with ST, collectively called _CS@Delft_, and with other departments across faculties in subsequent expansion cycles. Today, DAIC servers are organized as [partitions](/docs/manual/job-submission/partitions/) which correspond to the groups contributing these resources, as can be seen in Table 1.

 DAIC has been designed based on the needs of CS@Delft from the beginning. It has grown in time to serve researchers in other TU Delft Departments but maintained the needs of CS and AI in each expansion phase (See [TU Delft clusters comparison](/docs/introduction#tud-clusters)).

### SURF clusters
[SURF](https://www.surf.nl/en), the collaborative organization for IT in Dutch education and research, has installed and is currently operating the Dutch National supercomputer, [Snellius](https://www.surf.nl/en/dutch-national-supercomputer-snellius), which houses 144 40GB A100 GPUs as of Q3 2021 (36 gcn nodes x 4 A100 GPUs/node = 144 A100 GPUs total) with other specs detailed in the [Snellius hardware and file systems wiki](https://servicedesk.surf.nl/wiki/display/WIKI/Snellius+hardware+and+file+systems). 

SURF also operates other clusters like [Spider](https://servicedesk.surf.nl/wiki/display/WIKI/Spider+-+Description) for processing large structured data sets, and [ODISSEI Secure Supercomputer (OSSC)](https://servicedesk.surf.nl/wiki/display/WIKI/ODISSEI+Secure+Supercomputer) for large-scale analyses of highly-sensitive data. For an overview of SURF clusters, see the [SURF wiki](https://servicedesk.surf.nl/wiki/).

TU Delft researchers in TBM and CITG already have direct and easy access to the compute power and data services of SURF, while members of other faculties need to apply for access as detailed in [SURF's guide to Apply for access to compute services](https://www.surf.nl/en/research-it/apply-for-access-to-compute-services).

### TU Delft cloud resources
For both education and research activities, TU Delft has established the [Cloud4Research program](https://tu-delft-ict-innovation.github.io/Cloud4Research/). Cloud4Research aims to facilite the use of public cloud resources, primarily Amazon AWS. At the administrative level, Cloud4Research provides AWS accounts with an initial budget. Subsequent billing can be incurred via a project code, instead of a personal credit card. At the technical level, the ICT innovation teams provides intake meetings to facilitate getting started. Please refer to the [Policies](https://tu-delft-ict-innovation.github.io/Cloud4Research/policy/) and [FAQ](https://tu-delft-ict-innovation.github.io/Cloud4Research/faq/) pages for more details.
