  Overview of DAIC login nodes and appropriate usage guidelines.
---


Login nodes act as the gateway to the DAIC cluster. They are intended for lightweight tasks such as job submission, file transfers, and compiling code (on specific nodes). They are not designed for running resource-intensive jobs, which should be submitted to the [compute nodes](/docs/system/compute-nodes).

{{% alert title="Login1 resource limits (effective immediately)" color="warning" %}}

Due to excessive background usage (especially from VSCode-related processes), per-user limits on `login1` have been reduced to: 1 CPU, 1â€¯GB RAM. This helps prevent system-wide instability.  
For compiling large code or running memory-heavy tasks, please use an interactive job: [Interactive jobs on compute nodes](/docs/manual/job-submission/slurm-basics/#interactive-jobs-on-compute-nodes)
