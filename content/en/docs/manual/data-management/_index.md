## Data Management Guidelines
There are different use cases and quota limits for the different TU Delft network drives. For example, `Umbrella` (project storage), is for everybody and everything, while `bulk` needs to be cleaned up, migrated and phased out. Always check TU Delft {{< external-link "https://tudelft.topdesk.net/tas/public/ssp/content/detail/service?unid=f359caaa60264f99b0084941736786ae" "Overview data storage" >}} for guidelines on using network drives and quota limits.
