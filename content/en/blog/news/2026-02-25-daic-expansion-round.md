  DAIC Spring 2026 Expansion Round - Call for Participation
tags: ["expansion", "procurement", "infrastructure"]  
---

DAIC is opening its **Spring 2026 hardware expansion round**.  
Research groups interested in contributing compute resources are invited to participate.

Given current market signals indicating expected price increases (notably for memory components), it is important to consolidate commitments early to secure favorable pricing.

## Participation Window

Expressions of interest are requested **by mid-March 2026**.  
Final commitments will be coordinated directly with participating groups.

Deadlines will be enforced to ensure timely procurement.

## How to Participate

Groups interested in participating are encouraged to contact the [REIT team](reit-ewi@tudelft.nl) (example) to discuss:

- Intended contribution amount  
- Funding source and project code  
- Hardware preferences
