## TU Delft cloud resources

For both education and research activities, TU Delft has established the [Cloud4Research program](https://tu-delft-ict-innovation.github.io/Cloud4Research/). Cloud4Research aims to facilite the use of public cloud resources, primarily Amazon AWS. At the administrative level, Cloud4Research provides AWS accounts with an initial budget. Subsequent billing can be incurred via a project code, instead of a personal credit card. At the technical level, the ICT innovation teams provides intake meetings to facilitate getting started. Please refer to the [Policies](https://tu-delft-ict-innovation.github.io/Cloud4Research/policy/) and [FAQ](https://tu-delft-ict-innovation.github.io/Cloud4Research/faq/) pages for more details.
