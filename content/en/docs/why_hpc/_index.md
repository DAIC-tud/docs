## Purpose and Benefits of HPC Systems

A High Performance Computing (HPC) cluster, is a collection of (large) computing resources, like Processors (CPUs), Graphics processors (GPUs), Memory and Storage, that are shared among a group of users.

Using multiple computers as such makes it possible to perform lengthy and resource-intense computations beyond the capabilities of a single computer, and is especially handy for modern scientific computing applications where datasets are typically large in size, models are big in parameters' size and complexity, and computations need specialized hardware (like GPUs and FPGAs).
