## Access and accounts


DAIC is a cluster dedicated for TU Delft researchers (eg, PhD students, postdocs, .. etc) from participating groups (see [Brief history of DAIC](_index.md#brief-history-of-daic)). 

To access DAIC resources, eligible candidates from these groups can request an account via the [DAIC access request form](https://forms.office.com/e/tSAckyHevL)- also found below.
