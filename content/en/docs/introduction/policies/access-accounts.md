  What is required to access DAIC?
---



DAIC is a cluster dedicated for TU Delft researchers (eg, PhD students, postdocs, .. etc) from participating groups (see [Contributing departments](/docs/introduction/contributors)). 

To access DAIC resources, eligible candidates from these groups can request an account via the [DAIC access request form](https://forms.office.com/e/tSAckyHevL). 

Additionally, requests for resources reservations can also be accommodated (see [General cluster usage](/docs/introduction/policies/user-agreement#general-cluster-usage)).
