## Contributing departments
The Delft AI Cluster (DAIC - formerly known as INSY-HPC or just plainly HPC) is an HPC cluster that was initiated within the INSY department in 2015. Later, resources were joined with ST, collectively called _CS@Delft_, and with other departments across faculties in subsequent expansion cycles. Today, DAIC servers are organized as partitions (see [Batch Queuing System Overview ](/docs/introduction/system/scheduler#batch-queuing-system-overview)) that corresponds to the groups contributing these resources, as can be seen in Table 1.

 DAIC has been designed based on the needs of CS@Delft from the beginning. It has grown in time to serve researchers in other TU Delft Departments but maintained the needs of CS and AI in each expansion phase (See [TU Delft clusters comparison](tud-clusters)).
