## DAIC support & contact:
If the answer to your question is not found in any of the [Group-specific resources](../help#group-specific-resources), or the [Frequently Asked Questions](../faqs) consult with:
* DAIC community on:  [Mattermost](https://mattermost.tudelft.nl/signup_user_complete/?id=cb1k3t6ytpfjbf7r397395axyc&md=link&sbr=su) 
* DAIC support via the Self [Service Portal](https://tudelft.topdesk.net/tas/public/ssp/content/detail/service?unid=c6d0e44564b946eaa049898ffd4e6938).

* The linux bastions and the central storage are general IT facilities, *not* dedicated parts of the DAIC cluster. Direct your questions about those to their respective support teams.

{{% alert title="Stop!" color="warning" %}}
Do *not* send email directly to the personal email address of a DAIC system administrator, as that person may not always be able to respond immediately (i.e. outside office hours or when away or ill) and the other HPC support team members will not be able to see and respond to your question.
