  _Announcement:_ DAIC likely offline: [10-17] December 2025
---

DAIC is expected to be offline during the week [10-17] December due to planned work in TU Delft's data centers.

Please plan around this week: The planned work will affect other ICT services too, such as TU Delft Project services, DelftBlue, and virtual servers, but the impact is not yet confirmed. Please assume your own share may be unavailable during this period.

This is part of ICT-wide maintainance at TU Delft. For more information, please check:
